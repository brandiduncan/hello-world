# hello-world
My first repository creation

This is my code, there is much like it, but this is mine. My code is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I master my life. Without me it is useless, without my code I am useless.

My code is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus I will learn it as a sister, learn its weaknesses, its strengths, its parts. I will keep my code clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready.
